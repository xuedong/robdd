#       tp_bdd's README           #
#*********************************#

- What files/directories are there ?
   * this README file
   * Makefile to produce both
        * a toplevel configuration file 
        * and an executable from the main.ml file
   * test.ml to quick start with the toplevel
   * main.ml used to produce an executable file
   * init.ml to properly initialize the toplevel when building it
   * doc.mli : signatures of librairies functions you will need  
   * lib contains all the librairies required. 
        Libs are automatically compiled, read and loaded in the toplevel 
	when building it from Makefile

- What dependencies do I need ?
   * camlp5, to use the formulas parser and printer
   * ocamlfind
   * standard ocaml librairies nums.cma and toplevellib.cma
   * that should be it

- About the directory lib 
   * the librairies source files are included, ONLY for a compilation 
     purpose. Therefore, you should not waste your time trying to read the
     source code, and should better refer to the file doc.mli. This file
     gives you the names and signatures of the functions you will need. 
   * See main.ml and test.ml to see how to easily build propositional
     formulas using a dedicated syntax.

- How do I know whether everything is ok ?
   * run make in the root directory tp_bdd. All should compile correctly.
   * run ./main to run the executable
   * open test.ml with Emacs, launch the ocaml toplevel, evaluate the code. 

- It does not work. What can I do ? 
   * send a mail to paulin.fournier@inria.fr
